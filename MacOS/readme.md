## TROUBLESHOOTING:

### These aren't instructions?

You're right! I do not get paid enough to own a Mac (and they don't let you virtualize it lol) so I have no way to test this/set it up. And my roommate is currently futzing with her keyboard so it'll be a minute before I can get her to write this part for me.
